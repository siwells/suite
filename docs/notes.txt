Use a dynamic, extendable hash function to identify which DB server, from a pool of servers, to put a document into.

1. We need near constant O(1) time look-up of documents. Given a document ID we should be able to retrieve it directly from the DB pool.
2. Pool of DB servers must be extensible with minimal cost for data migration when new servers are added to the pool.
    2.1 Rehashing must be incremental
